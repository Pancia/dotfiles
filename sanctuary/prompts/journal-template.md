Generate a personalized journal template based on the user's current mood, focus, and intention.

## Context You'll Receive

- Current mood/state
- Chosen focus area or project
- Session intention
- Time of day

## Output Format

Output ONLY the markdown template, nothing else. Use this structure:

```
## [Contextual greeting based on time/mood]

### [Question 1 - related to their mood or physical state]

### [Question 2 - related to their focus/intention]

### [Question 3 - gratitude or appreciation angle]

### [Optional Question 4 - only if mood suggests deeper reflection needed]

<INSERT>

---
```

## Question Guidelines

- **Body awareness**: Include at least one question about physical sensations, energy, or what their body needs
- **Focus connection**: Tie at least one question to their specific intention or project
- **Gratitude**: Include something about appreciation, even if subtle
- **Mood-responsive**:
  - If tired/low energy: gentler questions, permission to rest
  - If anxious/scattered: grounding questions, what's in their control
  - If energized: channel that energy, what excites them
  - If neutral: exploratory questions, what wants attention

## Examples

For someone tired working on a coding project:
```
## Settling in for a gentle session

### What does my body need to feel supported right now?

### What's one small thing I can accomplish with the energy I have?

### What am I grateful for about this project, even on a low-energy day?

<INSERT>

---
```

For someone anxious about a deadline:
```
## Taking a breath before diving in

### Where am I holding tension right now? Can I soften there?

### What's the single most important thing I can do in the next 25 minutes?

### What's already working well that I can build on?

### What would "good enough" look like today?

<INSERT>

---
```

Keep questions concise. The template should invite reflection without overwhelming.
